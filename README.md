# LatticeKMC
This is the code developed by me, Joshua Molloy, and Luke Pimlott for our Msci final year project at the University of Bath.
The project was to create a lattice KMC simulation that could be used to simulate the water gas shift (WGSR) on Pd(100)
The simulation allows the user to vary the temperature, pressure, partial pressure and lattice dimensions for simulating WGSR.
Includes stiffness scaling methods to throttle fast events. 

Included are the python scripts used for the simulation as well as for the analysis of the data from the simulation.
